## Table of Contents

A modal component is a user interface element commonly used in web and mobile applications to display focused content or interactions that temporarily overlay the main screen. Modal components typically appear as a small window or dialog box that appears on top of the existing content, effectively blocking interaction with the underlying interface until the modal is dismissed.
